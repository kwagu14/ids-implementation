@par Example Description

Re-routing of the C library printf function to the UART.
The UART outputs a message on the HyperTerminal.

  |_STM32_Board_____________|

LED5 turns ON when there is an error.

The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The instruction cache (ICACHE) must be enabled by software to get a 0 wait-state execution
      from Flash memory and external memories, and reach the maximum performance.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L552ZETxQ devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L552E-EV board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.   

  - STM32L552E-EV Set-up
    Connect ST-Link cable to the PC USB port to display data on the HyperTerminal.
      A virtual COM port will then appear in the HyperTerminal.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Data Length = 7 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Flow control: None 

@note Due to the sharing of some I/Os of STM32L552ZET6QU by multiple peripherals,
      the following limitations apply in using the LED features:
      The green LED I/O cannot be operated simultaneously with JTAG SWO

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
