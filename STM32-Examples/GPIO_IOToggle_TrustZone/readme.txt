@par Example Description

How to use HAL GPIO to toggle secure and unsecure IOs when TrustZone security
is activated (Option bit TZEN=1).

The purpose of this example is to declare a secure IO with HAL GPIO and to toggle it
every second on Secure SysTick timer interrupt basis. All other IOs are released to
non-secure application and a non-secure IO is initialized by the non-secure application
to toggle every two seconds on Non-secure Systick timer interrupt basis.
Since LED toggling is controlled under both secure and non-secure Systick timers,
both Systick timers requires to be initialized with the same System clock frequency.

The secure IO is PG.12 which corresponds to LED10 and the non-secure toggling IO is
PD.13 for LED9.

The secure LED10 toggles every second and remains on in case of error in secure code.
The non-secure LED9 toggles twice faster and remains on in case of error in non-secure code.

This project is composed of two sub-projects:
- one for the secure application part (xxxxx_S)
- one for the non-secure application part (xxxxx_NS).

Please remember that on system with security enabled:
- the system always boots in secure and the secure application is responsible for
launching the non-secure application.
- the SystemInit() function in secure application sets up the SAU/IDAU, FPU and
secure/non-secure interrupts allocations defined in partition_stm32l562xx.h file.

This project shows how to switch from secure application to non-secure application
thanks to the system isolation performed to split the internal Flash and internal SRAM memories
into two halves:
 - the first half for the secure application and
 - the second half for the non-secure application.

User Option Bytes configuration:
Please note the internal Flash is fully secure by default in TZEN=1 and User Option Bytes
SECWM1_PSTRT/SECWM1_PEND and SECWM2_PSTRT/SECWM2_PEND should be set according to the application
configuration. Here the proper User Option Bytes setup in line with the project linker/scatter
file is as follows:
    TZEN=1
    DBANK=1
    SECWM1_PSTRT=0x0  SECWM1_PEND=0x7F  meaning all 128 pages of Bank1 set as secure
    SECWM2_PSTRT=0x1  SECWM2_PEND=0x0   meaning no page of Bank2 set as secure, hence Bank2 non-secure

This project is targeted to run on STM32L5 device on boards from STMicroelectronics.

This example configures the maximum system clock frequency at 110Mhz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The instruction cache (ICACHE) must be enabled by software to get a 0 wait-state execution
      from Flash memory and external memories, and reach the maximum performance.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L562QEIxQ devices with security enabled (TZEN=1).

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L562E-DK (MB1373)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool)
     TZEN = 1                            System with TrustZone-M enabled
     DBANK = 1                           Dual bank mode
     SECWM1_PSTRT=0x0  SECWM1_PEND=0x7F  All 128 pages of internal Flash Bank1 set as secure
     SECWM2_PSTRT=0x1  SECWM2_PEND=0x0   No page of internal Flash Bank2 set as secure, hence Bank2 non-secure
